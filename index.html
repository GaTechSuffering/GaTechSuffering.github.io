            This project was designed to be similar to that of an arcade cabinet that one would naturally see in an arcade.
            This arcade cabinet was designed with retro-styled games in mind, games that a lot of people have grown up with, 
            or games that have that 'feel good' vibe to them such as Pac-Man, Snake and Donkey Kong. 
            Since different people have different tastes in games, this project was aimed towards more simplistic games that
            children and adults alike can appreciate.

            <br><br>
            With that in mind, there are three simple games of which were created and then integrated into one single system for
            ease-of-access: 
            <br>  
            <br>
            Tic-Tac-Toe 
            <br> 
            Connect 4 
            <br> 
            Archery

        <div id="intro">
          <br><br>
          <p>
            ADD
          </p>

                <br>
                1. To set up this arcade cabinet, please first download the code and give it a read to understand how it works.
                   This will make things easier if the circuit needs to be debugged
                <br>
                2. Hardware and pinouts are assigned as seen below.
                   For additional pins on hardware, such as power and GND pins, please refer to embed wiki pages.
                   But if you dont want to, all power pins, except on speaker and class D amp, are connected to VCC = 3.3V on the mbed,
                   all GND are connected to GND on the mbed.
                   
                  
                   MPR 121 Capacitive touch pad 1 (p9,p10) 
                   ADD_VSS
                   IRQ 1 (p26)
                   MPR 121 Capacitive touch pad 2 (p9,p10) 
                   ADD_VDD
                   IRQ 2 (p25)
                   Bluetooth Module (p28,p27)
                   uLCD (p13,p14,p11)
                   Push Button 1 (p24)
                   Push Button 2 (p23)
                   Speaker (p21)
                   MMA8452 Accelerometer (p9,p10) 
                   0x3A
                   LED1, LED2, LED3
                   Class D Audio Amplifier
                   External 5V Power Supply and Jack
                   2x 4.7 kΩ pull up resistors on p9 and p10
                   560 Ω Voltage Dividing Speaker Resistor 
                   LPC1768 MCU
                <br>
                3. The 2x 4.7 kΩ pull up resistors are connected to p9 and p10 in parallel to the 3.3 rail, and are, as described, pull ups.
                   The 560Ω Resistor is a voltage divider, and is put across the output + and - on the class D amplifer to reduce voltage output.
                       - This reduceds output sound of the speaker.
                <br>
                4. The speaker and class D amp follow our pins outs, with the additional pins and pathings following the mbed page.
                   The only change that is required is to change the input voltage from the MCU (Vu of 5V) to an external DC source of 5V)
                   The MCU, can not handle all the output power draw from the components, so out sourcing the power for the speaker is required
                       The Class D amp pulls the most power relative to other hardware components
                <br>
                5. It can be seen that 3 components ( touch sensor 1, touch sensor 2, and accelerometer) all use pin 9 and 10 on the MCU for their
                   SDA and SCL lines. This works because the I2C port has 255 addresses on the buss, but to use these, you neeed to assign each
                   of the 3 hardware components a diffrent address.
                  
                   To do so, a change (as seen in step 1) to the touch sensor 2 is required in the code from ADD_VSS to ADD_VDD, and is also
                   required on the hardware. The sensor has uses the MPR121 which has a pin on the IC called ADDR on pin 4. The sensor has the
                   ADDR pin tied to a pad, and is pre soldered to another pad connected to VSS. To change the capacitive sensor to the VDD address
                   the pads need to be unsoldered, and resoldered so that pin 4 is connected to VDD.
                   Then if we assign touch sensor 2 to the address ADD_VDD, both sensors will work on the same pins (p9, and p10
                  
                   If the MMA8452 accelerometer has the same issues with using an already used address, do the same steps but for the MMA8452, and
                   it will also work on p9 and p10.
                <br>

            Our code contains accelerometre data (gravity, acceleration), capacitive touchpad input using interrupts, 
            and audio output using Class D Audio Amp and standard speaker for additional immersion.
            <br><br>
            It also contains software that integrates our uLCD, which will display all the games, and Adafruit Bluefruit,
            which will be used to select from the game screen.
